    "description": "We used to debug using developer tools in local, for the console and network tab for API issues. And for Vue, we use Vue Devtools to inspect component state and reactivity. I also use breakpoints in the sources tab to step through the code. In production, we rely on monitoring tools like Sentry to track runtime errors and performance issues.\n\nTo check performance of application, we use the performance tab or timelines to check the page load time and size.",
