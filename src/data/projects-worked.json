    "description": "Hi, I have around 7+ years of experience in frontend development. My work mainly involves managing frontend workflows and ensuring the application behaves correctly while building responsive, accessible, and scalable web applications.\n\nIn a recent project, I worked directly with the client to understand requirements, coordinated with different teams, implemented features, and handled bug fixes and accessibility improvements. In another project, I translated design mockups into responsive UI, optimized performance, and enhanced the overall user experience while collaborating closely with backend and design teams.\n\nI also focus on building reusable and maintainable UI components. For example, I developed a reusable table component used across multiple screens and a tokenizer-style search component for selecting guests and locations across different workflows.\n\nScalable means that the frontend code and components are designed so they can grow easily as the application adds more features, users, or screens without needing major rewrites.\n- Reusable components: Components can be used in multiple places. Example: A table component used for guest lists, visits, reports, etc.\n- Easy to extend: If a new feature is added, you can extend the existing component instead of rewriting it.",

If the user is inactive and the chat has ended, then a summary is generated only when the chat has ended or the chat is inactive for a long time. A message is then sent to the backend, and based on the request header, we receive the summary from the backend API. Using the session ID, I displayed the summary in the IH module (Interaction History).",
