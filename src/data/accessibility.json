I make sure the application is fully keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly. I use ARIA attributes when necessary and properly associate labels (Form Accessibility: link <label> and <input> using for and id) and aria-describedby to error messages with form inputs.\n\nSemantic HTML: I use appropriate semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <button>, instead of generic <div>.\n\nKeyboard Accessibility: ensure full keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Escape) by using tabindex carefully to manage focus.\n\nARIA Attributes: aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, role",
