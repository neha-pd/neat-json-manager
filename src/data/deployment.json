    "description": "We follow a three-stage branching strategy: dev, UAT, and prod. Each branch maps to its respective environment.\n\nWhen code is merged, the CI pipeline runs automatically based on a YAML configuration. It installs dependencies, executes tests, builds the production artifact, creates a Docker image, and pushes it to a container registry.\n\nThe CD pipeline then deploys the image using Kubernetes deployment YAML files to the appropriate environment. UAT and Production deployments require manual approval to ensure controlled releases.\n\nPost-deployment, we monitor logs and performance metrics using Splunk and Sentry to quickly detect and resolve issues.",
